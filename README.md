## Machine learning

In this blog, i will introduce what is Machine Learning, and how to build a simple easy project. I find the tutorial is very helpful for people to learn how to get involve in Machine Learning. Machine Learning is a hot topic since 2015 and can be use in many research area. Let's dive in and learn how it works! 

## Qt 

This tutorial will help you to learn how to build GUI by C++ programming language. Qt is a commercial GUI software, and it is free for develper to use it. Let's learn our first class for Qt development!

## Python 

In this blog, I will show you how to use python to create a small game and help you to understand how to use pygame library. There are some easy few steps to set up python game. Let us dive in and create the game!

## OpenCV

In this blog, I will introduce how to use OpenCV library in Python. OpenCV is a image processing library. It is very useful tool for image experiment including facial recognition and object detection and so on. Let us get involve to do hand on projects. 

## MATLAB

In this blog, I will show you how to use MATLAB to run computer vision's project. MATLAB is a very powerful programming language. It include it own toolbox to process images, such as camera calibration toolbox. It is a good start to learn how to fix camera from the toolbox.

## React 

In this blog, I will show you how to setup React.js environment. React is a JavaScript library create by facebook. Although learning React is hard enough, I want to simplify the process of environment setup.
